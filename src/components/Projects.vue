          <p>With 4.4 million customers, 1&1 Telecommunication SE is germanys largest alternative DSL provider after Deutsche Telekom. Since 2010, 1&1 has also been operating as a successful mobile phone provider and in 2019 took one step further towards becoming a successful full-service provider with the acquisition of 5G licenses.</p>
          <p>An important success factor is the sophisticated commission model of indirect sales, the technical development of which is my responsibility. Technical focus is on Java 11, Spring Boot, maven, Docker, grails, IBM ODM, postgreSQL and Sybase ASE.</p>
          <p>In addition to technical development and expansion, constantly growing demands and changing regulations require quick reaction time, good concepts and excellent communication skills.</p>

          <p>I completed my three-year professional training at HM Buchdata in Frankfurt, a system house with a broad customer base in the non-profit and public sectors and the economy.</p>
          <p>During my training I learned how to work in a structured way, how to deal with customers in a professional manner and how to respect experience. This demanded a lot of patience from my trainer, as I found other skills more important at the age of 15.</p>
          <p>However, my experience in programming enabled me to automate some internal processes, accelerate migrations and support my colleagues. After graduation I left the company immediately due to several moral concerns.</p>

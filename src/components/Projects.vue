          <h4>Senior Frontend Engineer, Oct 2017 - present</h4>
          <h4>Berlin, Germany</h4>
          <p>Outfittery is a curated fashion shopping service for men.</p>
          <p>Currently my responsibilities include strategical technical planning, continuous development and maintenance of the product, technical leadership for customer facing applications, interviewing frontend and QA engineers as well as filling and prioritizing the backlog with product managers. Besides continuously improving the product and code base my key achievements are planning the migration to React, establishing a frontend user group, setting up a JS style guide in our projects, enabling the design team to create a design guide and introducing a new careers page in collaboration with contractors.</p>

          <h4>Software Engineer, Oct 2016 - Sep 2017</h4>
          <h4>Berlin, Germany</h4>
          <p>Magine TV is an online television streaming platform.</p>
          <p>In this role I ensured that the code base can live up to latest web standards and best practices. This included upgrading the AngularJS version, rewriting most services and introducing Webpack and SCSS. I coded a majority of the new landing page on which users watch TV. I was able to plan and manage the process of developing and releasing a new help center with our customer support. The marketing teams could rely on me to get help with IT questions, the maintenance of the Wordpress CMS and respective code changes.</p>

          <h4>Software Engineer, Nov 2015 - Aug 2016</h4>
          <h4>Berlin, Germany</h4>
          <p>8MAN is an access rights management enterprise solution.</p>
          <p>This project gave me the opportunity to build this technically cutting edge web application. I made major technology and design decisions. Changes I introduced include rewriting and porting unstructured JavaScript code to TypeScript, unit testing with Jasmine and dropping the previous frontend framework in favor of Angular 2. I was also involved in the development of the C# ASP.NET Web API endpoints.</p>

          <h4>Software Engineer, Jan 2015 - Sep 2015</h4>
          <h4>Frankfurt Area, Germany</h4>
          <p>CloudBoot enables operating system deployment over the internet.</p>
          <p>For this project I developed the client and server side. The client is embedded inside an USB stick from which users boot into the application. The customer can install any operating system of their choice and has the convenience of pre-configured custom operating system images. An operating system installs unattended over the internet and optional configuration is possible through the client.</p>

          <h4>Frankfurt Area, Germany</h4>
          <p>RMS Viewer extends Windows Rights Management on iOS, Android, Windows RT and BlackBerry devices for mobile data security.</p>
          <p>I developed the server setup and update routine for this enterprise product. This required me to have good understanding of Windows Server 2008 - 2012 R2, IIS Webservices, NSIS and VBScript. Further responsibilities included the development and maintenance of our C++/CX Windows Store App. For the remaining mobile platforms I was able to help with manual testing and porting the code base.</p>

          <h4>Software Engineer, Oct 2016 - Sep 2017</h4>
          <h4>Berlin, Germany</h4>
          <p>Magine Germany operated an online television streaming platform which was discontinued in 2019. All customers were acquired by europeâ€™s leading online TV platform Zattoo.</p>
          <p>In this role I ensured that the code base can live up to latest web standards and best practices. This included upgrading the AngularJS version, rewriting most services and introducing Webpack and SCSS. I developed a majority of the page on which users watch TV. With the customer support team I was able to plan and release the Zendesk help desk. The marketing teams could rely on me to get help with IT questions, the maintenance of the Wordpress CMS and respective code changes.</p>

Enables companies and public authorities in protecting their IT systems by offering an easy-to-understand display, management and control of access and permission rights.</p>
          <p>This project gave me the opportunity to build this technically cutting edge web application. I made major technology and design decisions. Changes I introduced include rewriting and porting unstructured JavaScript code to TypeScript, unit testing with Jasmine and dropping the previous frontend framework in favor of Angular 2. I was also involved in the development of the C\# ASP.NET Web API endpoints.</p>

          <h4>Frankfurt Area, Germany</h4>
          <p>CloudBoot enables operating system deployment over the internet.</p>
          <p>For this project I developed the client and server side. The client is embedded inside an USB stick from which users boot into the application. The customer can install any operating system of their choice and has the convenience of pre-configured custom operating system images. An operating system installs unattended over the internet and optional configuration is possible through the client.</p>

          <p>RMS Viewer extends Windows Rights Management on iOS, Android, Windows RT and BlackBerry devices for mobile data security.</p>
          <p>I developed the server setup and update routine for this enterprise product. This required me to have good understanding of Windows Server 2008 - 2012 R2, IIS Webservices, NSIS and VBScript. Further responsibilities included the development and maintenance of our C++/CX Windows Store App. For the remaining mobile platforms I was able to help with manual testing and porting the code base.</p>
